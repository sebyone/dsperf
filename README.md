## Overview:

**dperf** is a network benchmarking tool designed to evaluate **performance** of standard networks by different methods: trip-time, traffic generator and much more. In addition, dperf allow to compare the performance of **underlay** and **overlay** network layers.
many of the tools available, while effective for standard IP networks, do not fully capture performance characteristics in modern, heterogeneous overlay network contexts, because they bypass the application layer and rely on specific IP protocols and subprotocols.

dperf uses a loopback-based methodology between two nodes (source and destination) to assess throughput, by leveraging native IPv4 sockets and the `libdaas` API with the a choosen driver.

## Why dperf?

- Independency on IP-specific protocols (e.g., ICMP).
- Process full-stack traversal.
- Full compatibility with abstracted and virtualized networking models.
- Measures bandwidth at both physical and logical layers
- Compatible with heterogeneous and virtualized environments
- Built with socket-based communication and libdaas support
- Enables side-by-side evaluation of underlay and overlay performance

## Key Concepts

The performances of a network can be evaluated with respect to four factors: **capabilities**, **availability**, **bandwidth** and **security**.

- **Capabilities**: Summarizes the functional capabilities.
- **Availability**: Accessibility and uptime of the network.
- **Bandwidth**: Refers to the rate of data that may be delivered over physical or logical links.
- **Security**: Summarizes the ability of the network to ensure the peers identification, confidentiality and integrity of the transferred information.


An **overlay network** is a model for defining one or more levels of abstraction of the physical network through software. The aim is to run multiple separate virtualized networks on the same physical infrastructure.

In an overlay network context, the **underline** and **overline** levels are identified. The technical resources, devices and protocols used to transport data are considered to belong to the underline layer.  Overlay layer refers to the software technologies and logical models adopted to virtualize access to the resources of the underline layer.

The use of overlay technologies brings numerous advantages and some relevant disadvantages.
Overlay brings incontrovertible benefits in terms of resilience, versatility and adaptability, however they require additional maintenance practices in addition to consuming network bandwidth, therefore a reduction in the network ability to transfer data.

**dperf** fills the gap where traditional tools fall short, offering precision and adaptability for next-generation network performance evaluation.

## Usage

### Client (Node A)
```bash
./dperf -s <host:port> --blocksize <bytes>|--packet-size <bytes> [-n <repetitions>|-c<ping-count>]  --underlay|--daas <daas.ini> [-f <file.csv>] 

```
### Server (Node B)
```bash
./dperf -S <port> --underlay|--daas <daas.ini>

```

## DaaS Ini File Example

```ini
[LOCAL]
DIN=101                         //Local Din
LINK_0=2                        //LINK_TYPE (check DaaS API for info)
URI_0=127.0.0.1:3001            //URI

[MAP]
REMOTE_DIN_0=102                //REMOTE NODE TO MAP
REMOTE_LINK_0=2                 //LINK_TYPE
REMOTE_URI_0=127.0.0.1:3002     //REMOTE URI
```

## Compile

Run the following commands in root directory

```bash
cmake .
cmake --build .
```
You can choose to not link DaaS with
```bash
cmake -DNODAAS=ON .
```
Then you can run the executable `dperf`!

## Examples

Transfer of a data block of 10 MB

### start server
```bash
./dperf -S 5001 --underlay
```

### start client
```bash
./dperf --underlay -s 127.0.0.1:5001 --blocksize 1024000000 -y -n 10 > data_100M.csv

sed 's/\\./,/g' data_100M.csv > datav_100M.csv
```

or:

```bash
./dperf --underlay -s 127.0.0.1:5001 --blocksize 1024000000 -y -n 10 | sed 's/\\./,/g' > datav_100M.csv
```

### start client (overlay mode)

```bash
./dperf -s 102 --daas node_setup.ini --blocksize 1024000000
```

### start server (overlay mode)

```bash
./dperf -S 101 --daas node_setup2.ini
```
